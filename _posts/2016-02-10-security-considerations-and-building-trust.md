In September last year, the [Free Software Sydney meet-up group](http://freesoftware.org.au/sydney/) had an inaugural [Jitsi Meet](http://meet.jitsi.org/) videoconference.

My (longer-than-planned) contribution to the conference aimed at introducing trust and security concepts, mainly in showing the prevalent role of hashes, and covered public-key cryptography uses, GPG, SSL CAs, trusting trust and reproducible builds.

[PDF slides are available here](http://narf.jencuthbert.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/02/2015-09-10mehani_trust.pdf).

As a side note, thanks to [this post](https://superuser.com/questions/138331/using-ffmpeg-to-cut-up-video#704118), hereâ€™s a quick way to extract a clip off a longer video with `ffmpeg`. I did however have to fiddle with the time to seek to, and ended up seeking to about 10 minutes before the actual time of the beginning of the segment.````
