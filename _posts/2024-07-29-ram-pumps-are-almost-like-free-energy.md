Our house doesn’t have access to town water. Instead, we have a large water tank fed by rain water. Unfortunately, there is never enough rain to fill it, and we often need to get water delivered. This has made us more aware of our water usage.

Even more so when it comes to the garden: it requires more watering in summer, when there is even less rain filling the tank. We happen to have a creek nearby, that flows all year round. The local regulations allow us to take water out to water adjacent land, but going back and forth with 10L watering cans gets old quickly.

I discovered, in a random video, the [concept of ram pumps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_ram). Those are [mechanical pumps that use the pressure from height differentials](https://youtu.be/zFdyqTGx32A) between a water intake location and that of the pump to push a trickle up, higher than the intake. As it sounded like a good way to bring water up to a tank in the garden, I decided to give it a try. Ram pumps are all the more attractive as they don’t require any external source of power beyond the water to pump itself.

tl;dr:

- Ram pumps are [surprisingly easy to build](https://piaille.fr/@shtrom/112308885695920573)
- All parts but the brass waste valve can be found at [Bunnings (local big hardware store)](https://www.bunnings.com.au/)
- With about a metre of drop, I can pump water about 5 metres up, at a rate of 500L/day
- The adjustment of the in-take line is a bit tricky, but easily, if temporarily, fixed.

There are many tutorials and videos about making ram pumps, but they all boil down to a couple of ball valves, a brass swing valve, a check valve, and a vertical air chamber. The trickiest is mapping the parts list to what’s available from local stores. While I started with [an instructable](https://www.instructables.com/Hydraulic-Ram-Pump/), I ultimately found a [clearer how-to](https://www.craftyamigo.com/projects/build-your-ram-pump). Crucially, what made the latter easier to work was the diagrams being labelled with the parts list, rather than separate lists and pictures.

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized">![Water Ram Pump Plans diagrams (groups 1 & 2) from https://www.craftyamigo.com/projects/build-your-ram-pump](https://blog.narf.ssji.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/craftyamigo_rampump_group12.jpg)</figure></div>This allowed me to make a list of locally-sourceable parts. Everything can be found at Bunnings, except for the [brass swing check valve, which I got from Valves Online](https://www.valvesonline.com.au/brass-swing-check-valve). Also, metric!

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized">![PVC bits and fittings, on an outdoors bench. A couple of tees have been fitted with threaded ends to match valves sitting around them.](https://blog.narf.ssji.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/PXL_20240421_0745418722-Copy-edited.jpg)</figure></div>The following parts make most of the pump, all in pressure-rated PVC fittings, barring the air chamber.

- 2x [25mm ball valves](https://www.bunnings.com.au/holman-25mm-pvc-ball-valve_p5070438)
- 1x [25mm inline spring check valve](https://www.bunnings.com.au/holman-25mm-pvc-ball-valve_p5070438)
- 2x [25mm plain tees](https://www.bunnings.com.au/holman-25mm-press-pvc-plain-tee_p3142350)
- 5x [25mm male thread adaptor](https://www.bunnings.com.au/holman-25mm-x-1-press-pvc-bsp-male-thread-adaptor_p3142839) (for each horizontal side of the tees, and one up to the brass swing valve)
- [(Red) PVC priming fluid](https://www.bunnings.com.au/protek-500ml-red-priming-fluid_p4750124) and [type-P (pressure, green) PVC cement](https://www.bunnings.com.au/protek-500ml-type-p-green-pvc-cement-for-high-pressure-pipes_p3140035)

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized">![A partially-assembled ram pump. A series of PVC bins and fittings are at the front, and a larger pipe is visible at the back.](https://blog.narf.ssji.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/PXL_20240427_071049741-Copy-edited.jpg)</figure></div>The air chamber turned into a bit of an exercise, as 100mm pressure pipe and fittings were only available as special order, and I was impatient. The problem is that pressure pipes are, unsurprisingly, thicker than non-pressure equivalents. This means the fittings are not directly compatible, and they can’t be mixed and matched.

Instead, I used a number of reducing bushes to go from 25mm to 50mm pressure pipes then added a threaded socket. In this socket goes a 50mm non-pressure thread, which is immediately changed to a 100m pipe that the air chamber is made of. In order,

- [25mm PVC pressure pipe](https://www.bunnings.com.au/holman-25mm-x-1m-class-12-pressure-pvc-pipe_p4770100) (only 5–10cm needed)
- [25mm to 40mm PVC pressure reducer](https://www.bunnings.com.au/holman-40-x-25mm-press-pvc-reducing-coupling_p3141061)
- [40mm PVC pressure pipe](https://www.bunnings.com.au/holman-40mm-x-1m-class-12-press-pvc-pipes_p4750050) (only 5–10cm needed)
- [40mm to 50mm PVC pressure reducer](https://www.bunnings.com.au/holman-50-x-40mm-press-pvc-reducing-bush_p3142318)
- [50mm pressure threaded socket](https://www.bunnings.com.au/holman-50mm-x-2-press-pvc-faucet-socket_p3142245)
- [50mm non-pressure male thread adaptor](https://www.bunnings.com.au/holman-50mm-pvc-dwv-male-threaded-iron-adaptor_p4750158)
- [50mm to 100mm non-pressure reducer](https://www.bunnings.com.au/holman-100-x-50mm-m-f-pvc-dwv-socket-reducer_p4750193)
- [100mm non-pressure coupling slip](https://www.bunnings.com.au/holman-industries-100mm-dwv-pvc-coupling-slip_p4750199)
- [100mm non-pressure pipe](https://www.bunnings.com.au/holman-100mm-x-1m-pvc-dwv-pipe_p4770090) (about 46cm needed)
- [100mm non-pressure push-on cap](https://www.bunnings.com.au/holman-100mm-pvc-dwv-push-on-cap_p4770360)

This adds up to a total of about $165 at Bunnings, and another $15-ish for the brass swing valve (not including postage). My actual pump, through the magic of trial-and-error, is made up of more parts (and more errors) than this. I hope my hindsight could be the reader’s foresight.

As I didn’t have any on hand, I went for the more expensive option of making the air chamber re-openable, by replacing the push-on cap with a [threaded access coupling](https://www.bunnings.com.au/holman-100mm-pvc-dwv-threaded-access-coupling_p4760086) and [matching access cap](https://www.bunnings.com.au/holman-100mm-pvc-dwv-threaded-access-cap_p4770362). It only just occurs to me now that I already have some sort of access via the bottom thread…

People have cautioned me against the use of non-pressure pipes, but to those nay-sayers I say: she’ll be right.

However, it took a while to put it in a situation where it would keep going. The main issues I encountered were fallen leaves clogging the intake, the ram shock dislodging the intake, and more generally air locks creating in the polypipe. In general, I found that just lowering or lifting the pipe a few times to get the water moving again was sufficient to restart the system. Since then, I have found [this video, which uses a silt bucket and a standpipe to get a cleaner and more controllable flow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiTN1UNPDp8).

With this, I could fill a 10L watering can placed just next to the pump in about 10 minutes. With some more polypipe, this time 13mm, I drove the output of the pump all the way up to the highest part of the garden. There is an 1kL IBC there to receive and store the water. It took about 2 day for the IBC to fill, which gives us a rate of about 500L/day.

I have taken the remainder of the 13mm polypipe back down to the creek, with a few drippers to automatically water some plants along the way, and fill the chickens’ watering through. I now want to redistribute the overflow to more plants, which may leave us in a situation where we don’t even need to do the watering ourselves.

The web of ram pump is very deep, and has a lot of the classic in-line-with-air-chamber design used here. I however happened upon [this video, which builds a pump in quite a different way, including manually making spring valves instead of using a swing valve](https://youtu.be/DFGvAYUc7gM?si=FLzLNDzafXsKFPn7), which was a nice variation. The next bit of hydraulic magic I now want to experiment with is a bell syphon, to create a bigger, periodic, release of water for… something?
