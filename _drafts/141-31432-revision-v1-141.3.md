- Continuing to work on a CTCSS generator for my [AWA RT85](https://blog.narf.ssji.net/tag/awa-rt85/)
- Disconnected the original 91.5Hz generator, and fed the output of my 141.3Hz test circuit via a 150kΩ resistor, as described in the radio’s manual 
    - It worked! I can trigger a local repeater, hear myself on another radio, and also detecet the 141.3 when tone-scanning. All success!
    - I guess the radio wasn’t happy with the old CTCSS generator in parallel. It mush have been halving the equivalent resistance, and drowning out the signal. 
        - Probably a compressor somewhere downstream of it.
    - Need to see if the trimmer is even needed
- Now, I need to get the right connectors, and put it on a better board. 
    - I started playing with KiCad last night. I also need to hook the lines from the channel memory so I can switch to the programmed tone.
