Dears sir or madam,

Please reconsider the price of Sydney train tickets.

With the recent increase in Sydney Train fares, I considered the viability of using the network. I work all week in the same place, less than 10 Klicks from where I live. I used to buy weekly MyTrain tickets, which went from $26 to $28 \[1\]. I travel to and from work once a day, every day of the week. A return off-peak ticket now costs $5, that is $25, $3 less than the weekly or $156 per year. *Charging regular travellers more than occasional ones doesn’t sound like the best way to incentivise use of the service*.

The fortnightly ticket is now $56 \[2\]. This made me wonder how much driving would cost. I have a recent small car well adapted for the city: cheap to drive and easy to park. Driving to work takes pretty much the same time, yet is more flexible and convenient. I did a small experiment, where my partner drove me to work, and came pick me up (she sometimes needs the car during the day), every day for a week. The experiment started with a full tank, and 10 return trips later, plus a few daily errands, emptied the tank of 28.75 L which, at 145.5 ¢pL is $41.35 (this is at odds with the $133pw that the fare calculator \[1\] suggest, considering I already own a car; it also grossly overestimates the yearly distance to 15000Km, while this commute is barely a third \[9\*2\*5\*52=4680\]). *The car-equivalent of a daily train commute for two weeks, including unrelated errands, is more than 25 % cheaper*.

To get some perspective, we can compare a single fare to, say, median weekly incomes, and the average price of a pint.

- Sydney: $3.80/$3.30 (Opal, &lt; =10Km) \[1\], AU$1,250 (2012) \[3\], AU$5.05 \[4\]; 3.0%/75.3%
- Paris: €1.70/€1.37 (10 travels, Zone 1) \[5\], €470 (average minus 20% tax; 2010) \[6\], €6.34 \[4\]; 3.6%/26.8%
- London: GBP4.7/GBP2.2 (Oyster card, Zone 1) \[7\], GBP419 (2008) \[8\], GBP3.6 \[4\]; 11.2%/130.6%
- New York: $2.50 \[9\], US$1109 (2008–2012) \[10\], US$5.75 \[4\]; 2.3%/43.5%

Arguably, the introduction of the Opal card might help mitigate the unfairness to regular users. However, the prices advertised in \[1\] are still not competitive with taking one’s car and driving. Public transports have many advantages for society, in the form of more efficient and environment-friendly commutes. The prices of train tickets, however, do not currently induce the commuter to choose this option. *It would be wise to revisit Sydney Train fare prices, both MyTrain and Opal, to make them more coherent, and actually competitive with other means of transportation*.
