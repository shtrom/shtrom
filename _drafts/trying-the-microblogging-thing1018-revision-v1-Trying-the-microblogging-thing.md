 I’ve never had a personal Twitter account, mainly for fear of the time sink and doom-scrolling. I wanted to avoid both. I recently obtained an invite to BlueSky, which I took, out of curiosity. The next obvious thing to do was to [open an account on the Fediverse](https://piaille.fr/@shtrom), and use that (I had one on a self-hosted Nextcloud Social instance, but the server is now firewalled, so not quite social enough).

I quite like the liveliness and congeniality of the discussion there, and I was glad to find a few familiar faces, some that I have been following for decades before. It’s nice to receive everything in one place. Though it does revive my fears of time-sink.

This [blog is now also a node in the fediverse](https://wordpress.com/support/enter-the-fediverse/), you can follow what I post here at `@shtrom@blog.narf.ssji.net`. When thinking more about how to make it useful, I also realised that I have a number of ongoing projects that I work on-and-off on. So far, I have been keeping progress notes, and writing a longer blog post in the end. With this integration with the Fediverse, I want to try something new, posting quick updates about progress, blockers and discoveries.

I’ll use the freshly minted [µblog category](/category/%c2%b5blog/), along with a tag per project, to classify those posts. They will not be displayed on the main page, but will pushed via the fediverse to willing followers. I’ll still write full articles in the end
