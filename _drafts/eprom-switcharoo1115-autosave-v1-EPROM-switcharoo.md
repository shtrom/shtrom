- Working on [Updating channel memory on decommissioned AWA RT85 radio](https://blog.narf.ssji.net/2023/11/25/updating-channel-memory-awa-rt85-ham-radio/)
- Managed to desolder the original MC27C16 EPROM 
    - The heat gun approach worked a treat, particularly as it had a 50-450°C range, so I could avoid overheating the board with only 150–200°C
- Dumped the EPROM data, and re-loaded it on an AT28C16
- Put a DIP24 socket in the daughter board, and the 28C16 in it 
    - It’s a snug fit, but it’s a fit
- Realised that I didn’t have an RT85A, but an original RT85, according to <https://www.qsl.net/vk3byy/rt85/rt85data.html> (VK3BYY) 
    - There is an archive.org of a page from VK3TAE about it <https://web.archive.org/web/20100618044202/http://www.users.on.net/~gbear/rt85.html>, and particularly the [programming data](https://web.archive.org/web/20050615023352/http://keycom.d2.net.au/rt85.pdf) (took copies for later reference)
    - At a glance, the programming data matches what’s in the EEPROM
